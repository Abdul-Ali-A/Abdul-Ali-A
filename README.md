### Hi there 👋 I'm Abdul Ali

I am an AI Engineer focused on Scalable Applications & LLM Architecture.

I specialize in building production-ready AI systems using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face**. Most recently, I completed an 8-week research intensive focused on the low-level mechanics of Transformers, including building tokenizers and training loops from scratch.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
* **Research:** Reverse-engineering BERT & GPT tokenization algorithms (See my [Advanced LLM Engineering](https://github.com/Abdul-Ali-A/advanced-llm-engineering)repo).
* **Development:** Building a Multi-LLM Summarizer API that benchmarks cost vs. quality across GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Grok.
